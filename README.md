# Tic-Tac-Toe

After reviving my childhood memories through the old-school game, Stone (rock), Paper, and Scissors. I thought of making another old memory - Tic Tac Toe into a mini-project out of Python GUI and OOPs. 

The interface allows two options - Player vs Player, for two users and Player vs Computer, for single users.
